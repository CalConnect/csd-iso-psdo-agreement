The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is global
non-profit organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of
technologies across collaborative systems and applications.
CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization)
is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.
