ISO and CalConnect acknowledge that all documents,
data or electronic files provided by each consisting of or relating to
joint publications are copyrighted property and data and will not be
supplied to any other party without the prior written consent of the
copyright owner, and will not be used, in whole or in part, as a basis

Each organization will promptly notify the
other if it becomes aware of infringements or imitations by others of
a joint publication.

purposes and in accordance with ISO policies for the circulation of
draft standards and working documents.

// From OGC

deliverables under this agreement.



[[copyright-exploitation]]
=== Copyright and exploitation rights

[[copyright-adopted]]
==== Of adopted standards

The copyright in any resulting ISO/CalConnect International Standard(s) published according to
<<principles-adoption>>, including any future versions of such Standard(s), remain with
the source party.

The adopting party will neither acquire nor assert copyright ownership or any
other proprietary rights in these ISO/CalConnect International Standard(s).

The source party retains all copyrights in the CalConnect Product(s) and
ISO/CalConnect International Standard(s) not specifically granted
hereunder.

Subject to the exploitation rights granted above, development by the adopting party (or its members)
of any other work affecting the integrity of the source standard or the ISO/CalConnect International
Standard(s) would need a separate agreement with the source party.



[[copyright-codevelopment]]
==== Of jointly developed standards

////
ISO and CalConnect individually retain the rights to publish all
documents developed under this agreement according to their own
practices.
////

Joint deliverables developed through the joint development process according to
<<principles-codevelopment>>,
copyright ownership will be held jointly by ISO
and CalConnect with normal exploitation rights for CalConnect and for
ISO and its members, including for national adoption purposes.

ISO and CalConnect may each sell and distribute the jointly developed standard,
in accordance with their own rules, without any royalties to the other.

The resulting joint publication is common to both organizations.

//ISO and CalConnect will agree on the list price for any resulting
//ISO/CalConnect publication.

[[republishing]]
=== Re-publishing

ISO and CalConnect agree that any re-publishing of content
developed under this agreement, such as the national adoption
of a joint publication by an ISO member body, or the re-publishing
of a joint publication by another organization,
will adhere to this agreement.

Publishing arrangements between ISO and ISO member countries are
unchanged by this agreement.


=== Statement indicating source

ISO and CalConnect agree that the resulting publication created with
the joint deliverable will contain a suitable statement that describes
the base standard the joint deliverable was derived from.


=== Notification of right infringement

Each party shall promptly inform the other party if it becomes aware of
any copyright infringement or potential infringement of a joint publication.

CalConnect and ISO shall consult with each other to decide the best
way to respond to such infringement.
